        <div class="about">Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury (lead vocals,
            piano), Brian May
            (guitar, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), later joined by John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works
            were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock, and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more
            conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.

            Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and
            encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and
            suggested the name " Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their
            self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974.
            Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The
            latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody" , which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped
            popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You"
            and "We Are the Champions" , which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were
            one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from The Game (1980) became
            their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the
            UK and is certified nine times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked
            among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last
            performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. Though he kept his condition private, Mercury was diagnosed
            with AIDS in 1987. The band released two more albums, The Miracle in 1989 and Innuendo in 1991. On 23
            November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed that he had AIDS, and the next day died of bronchopneumonia, a
            complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocal, 1995's Made in Heaven. John
            Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004,
            they have toured as "Queen +" , with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert. Queen have been a global
            presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250
            million to 300 million, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received
            the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
            of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the
            Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song
            Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 were presented the
            Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</div>

            <p class="performance-title">5. ‘A Kind Of Magic’ (Wembley Stadium, 1986)</p>
            <p class="performance-description">On a Friday night at Wembley in July 1986, Mercury was dressed in one of
                his most iconic outfits: a
                bright yellow jacket in a military style, with multi-buckle fastenings and a pair of white trousers with
                red and gold piping. As he clicked his fingers and slowly eased into a pulsating version of ‘A Kind Of
                Magic’, Mercury was in full command of the show. “We are a bit flashy, but I also think we’re
                sophisticated, the music’s not one big noise. It’s not glam rock, either. We’re in the show business
                tradition,” the Queen frontman said. The performance showed drummer Taylor, who wrote the song, at his
                best, holding it together with a magnificent beat.</p>

            <p class="performance-title">4. We Are The Champions’ (Montreal, 1981)</p>
            <p class="performance-description">‘We Are The Champions’ was one of Queen’s greatest live songs, and
                brilliant versions from around the world
                – including Budapest, Frankfurt, and Tokyo – survive. The one from Montreal in 1981, where Mercury is
                wearing white shorts and a red neckerchief, was masterful. “I just cook on stage! To me, playing in
                front of
                a big crowd – that kind of surge – is unequaled,” said Mercury. “The feeling I get from the audience is
                greater than sex. I love the excitement of it and I always feel that I want more – more, more, more. I’m
                just a musical tart!” This version of ‘We Are The Champions’ shows a top showman singing a fantastic
                feel-good song.</p>

            <p class="performance-title">3. ‘Somebody To Love’ (Milton Keynes Bowl, 1982)</p>
            <p class="performance-description">Mercury described ‘Somebody To Love’ as “a killer to do live,” because it
                involved bringing to the stage
                a song that had been expertly produced in the studio with layered voices. He said the key to performing
                the song live was to “put across the atmosphere of the song on stage”. That is what Mercury did to
                perfection with his spirited, fast performance of this Queen classic at the Milton Keynes Bowl in June
                1982. “Are you ready, brothers and sisters?” shouted Mercury, who was playing the piano as he launched
                into a passionate eight-minute version of a song he had written for the 1976 album A Day At The Races.

            <p class="performance-title">2: ‘We Will Rock You’ (Rock In Rio, Brazil, 1985)</p>
            <p class="performance-description">Mercury was a born performer. He once said that it was “awe-inspiring and
                mind-boggling to be up there
                with all those people in the palm of your hand”. In January 1985, Queen headlined two nights of Rock In
                Rio, the biggest music festival the world had ever seen. More than a quarter of a million Brazilian fans
                joined in with the singing on a gripping version of Queen’s stadium anthem ‘We Will Rock You’. The
                concerts were broadcast throughout Brazil by Globo, and each show was watched by nearly 200 million
                people in more than 60 countries.</p>

            <p class="performance-title">1: ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ (Live Aid, Wembley Stadium, 1985)</p>
            <p class="performance-description">Queen’s 1976 tour-de-force, ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, opened the band’s
                celebrated Live Aid set in July 1985.
                “The concert may have come out of a terrible human tragedy, but we want to make it a joyous occasion,”
                said Mercury before the show. They did just that. The performance of his masterpiece set the tone for a
                mesmerizing gig. Mercury jogged out on stage and welcomed the crowd like they were 72,000 close friends;
                by the time he sat down at the piano and hit the first few notes of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, he was the
                absolute master of the stadium. The pressure of performing to a global television audience brought out
                the best in Mercury, who showed that day that he was one of the greatest live performers of his
                generation.</p>
